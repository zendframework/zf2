### UPDATES IN 2.3.0

- [#5043](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/5043) introduced changes in
  how DocBlock tag instances are returned via the `Zend\Code\Reflection`
  component. These instances are rarely created manually; however, if you are
  doing so, please note the following API changes:
  - `Zend\Code\Generator\DocBlock\Tag\AuthorTag`: removed `set/getDatatype()` and
    `set/getParamName()`
  - `Zend\Code\Generator\DocBlock\Tag\AuthorTag`: `__construct` changed from
    `($options = array())` to `($authorName = null, $authorEmail = null)`
  - `Zend\Code\Generator\DocBlock\Tag\LicenseTag`: `__construct` changed from
    `($options = array())` to `($url = null, $licenseName = null)`
  - `Zend\Code\Generator\DocBlock\Tag\ReturnTag`: `__construct` changed from
    `($options = array())` to `($types = array(), $description = null)`
  - `Zend\Code\Generator\DocBlock\Tag\ParamTag`: `__construct` changed from
    `($options = array())` to `($variableName = null, $types = array(),
    $description = null)`
  - Using `DocBlockGenerator::fromReflection()` and afterwards `getTags()` is now
    returning the new `Tag` classes (`ReturnTag`, `AuthorTag`, `ParamTag`, ...)
    where applicable and otherwise `GenericTag`. The deprecated class `Tag` will
    not be returned anymore.
- [#5101](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/5101) introduces a behavior
  change in the FormLabel view helper: it now escapes the label content by
  default. If you wish to disable escaping, you need to either pass the label
  option `disable_html_escape` to the form element, or call the
  `setEscapeHtmlHelper(false)` method on the `formLabel()` view helper.
- [#4962](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4962) adds a service alias
  from "ControllerManager" to "ControllerLoader", and updates code to reference
  that alias ("ControllerManager"). This makes the service name match the class
  name, and begins future-proofing the component.
- [#5283](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/5283) deprecates the trait
  `Zend\EventManager\ProvidesEvents` in favor of
  `Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareTrait`, and now raises an
  `E_USER_DEPRECATED` when loaded. Please update your code to use the newer
  trait.

- [#5343](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/5343) removed the
  DateTimeFormatter filter from DateTime form elements. This was done
  due to the fact that it led to unexpected behavior when non-date inputs were
  provided. However, since the DateTime element already incorporates a
  DateValidator that accepts a date format, validation can still work as
  expected.

Please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
