## RELEASE INFORMATION

*Zend Framework 2.1.4dev*

This is the fourth maintenance release for the version 2.1 series.

DD MMM YYYY

### UPDATES IN 2.1.4

Better polyfill support in `Zend\Session` and `Zend\Stdlib`. Polyfills
(version-specific class replacements) have caused some issues in the 2.1 series.
In particular, users who were not using Composer were unaware/uncertain about
what extra files needed to be included to load polyfills, and those users who
were generating classmaps were running into issues since the same class was
being generated twice.

New polyfill support was created which does the following:

- New, uniquely named classes were created for each polyfill base.
- A stub class file was created for each class needing polyfill support. A
  conditional is present in each that uses `class_alias` to alias the appropriate
  polyfill base as an import. The stub class then extends the base.
- The `compatibility/autoload.php` files in each component affected was altered
  to trigger an `E_USER_DEPRECATED` error asking the user to remove the require
  statement for the file.

The functionality works with both Composer and ZF2's autoloading support, using
either PSR-0 or classmaps. All typehinting is preserved.

Please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
