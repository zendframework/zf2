    <para>
        <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\Mail</classname> writes log entries in an email message
        by using <classname>Zend\Mail</classname>. The <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\Mail</classname>
        constructor takes a <classname>Zend\Mail\Message</classname> object to compose the message,
        and an optional <classname>Zend\Mail\Transport</classname> object to send the email (the
        default transport is <classname>Zend\Mail\Transport\Sendmail</classname>).
    </para>

    <para>
        The primary use case for <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\Mail</classname> is notifying
        developers, systems administrators, or any concerned parties of errors
        that might be occurring with <acronym>PHP</acronym>-based scripts.
        <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\Mail</classname> was born out of the idea that if
        something is broken, a human being needs to be alerted of it immediately
        so they can take corrective action.
    </para>

    <para>
        Basic usage is outlined below:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$mail = new Zend\Mail\Message();
$mail->setFrom('errors@example.org')
     ->addTo('project_developers@example.org');

$writer = new Zend\Log\Writer\Mail($mail);

// Set subject text for use; summary of number of errors is appended to the
// subject line before sending the message.
$writer->setSubjectPrependText('Errors with script foo.php');

// Only email warning level entries and higher.
$writer->addFilter(Zend\Log\Logger::WARN);

$log = new Zend\Log\Logger();
$log->addWriter($writer);

// Something bad happened!
$log->error('unable to connect to database');

// On writer shutdown, send() is triggered to send an email with
// all log entries at or above the Zend\Log\Logger filter level.
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\Mail</classname> will render the email body as plain
        text.
    </para>

    <para>
        One email is sent containing all log entries at or above the filter
        level. For example, if warning-level entries an up are to be emailed,
        and two warnings and five errors occur, the resulting email will contain
        a total of seven log entries.
    </para>
