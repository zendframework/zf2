    <para>
        <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\ZendMonitor</classname> allows you to log events via Zend
        Server's Monitor <acronym>API</acronym>. This allows you to aggregate log messages for your
        entire application environment in a single location. Internally, it simply uses the
        <methodname>monitor_custom_event()</methodname> function from the Zend Monitor
        <acronym>API</acronym>.
    </para>

    <para>
        One particularly useful feature of the Monitor <acronym>API</acronym> is that it allows you
        to specify arbitrary custom information alongside the log message. For instance, if you wish
        to log an exception, you can log not just the exception message, but pass the entire
        exception object to the function, and then inspect the object within the Zend Server event
        monitor.
    </para>

    <note><title>Zend Monitor must be installed and enabled</title>
        

        <para>
            In order to use this log writer, Zend Monitor must be both installed and enabled.
            However, it is designed such that if Zend Monitor is not detected, it will simply act as
            a <constant>NULL</constant> logger.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>
        Instantiating the <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\ZendMonitor</classname> log writer is trivial:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$writer = new Zend\Log\Writer\ZendMonitor();
$logger = new Zend\Log\Logger($writer);
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        Then, simply log messages as usual:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger->info('This is a message');
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        If you want to specify additional information to log with the event, pass that information
        in a second parameter:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger->info('Exception occurred', $e);
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        The second parameter may be a scalar, object, or array; if you need to pass multiple pieces
        of information, the best way to do so is to pass an associative array.
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger->info('Exception occurred', array(
    'request'   => $request,
    'exception' => $e,
));
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        Within Zend Server, your event is logged as a "custom event". From the "Monitor" tab, select
        the "Events" sub-item, and then filter on "Custom" to see custom events.
    </para>

    <para>
        In this screenshot, the first two events listed are custom events logged via the
        <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\ZendMonitor</classname> log writer. You may then click on an event to view all
        information related to it.
    </para>

    <para>
        Event detail in Zend Server's Monitor
    </para>

    <para>
        Clicking on the "Custom" sub tab will detail any extra information you logged by passing the
        second argument to the logging method. This information will be logged as the
        <varname>info</varname> subkey; you can see that the request object was logged in this
        example.
    </para>
