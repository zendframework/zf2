Welcome to the Zend Framework 2.0.0 Release! 

RELEASE INFORMATION
---------------
Zend Framework 2.0.0beta1

THIS RELEASE IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE AND NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.
PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is the first in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle will follow the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen no less than every six weeks. 

Once the established milestones have been reached and the featureset has
reached maturity and reasonable stability, we will freeze the API and
prepare for Release Candidate status.
